			<p>Dear Class,</p>
			<p>I am sorry that I was not able to make it to class today! There are two resources that I wanted to provide to you that should help with creating your mock-up/website concept:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>A video that helps to show how PowerPoint can be used for this purpose.</li>
					<li>A video to help you decide on a color palette that will look great.</li>
				</ol>
			<p>I expect to return to school next week. Please do not hesitate to email me with any questions before your concept is due on <b><u>Thursday, April 11, 2019</u></b>. Remember that your group will be sharing your presentation with the class! It is recommended that the presentation be saved to a thumb drive for easy access through the smartboard.</p>
