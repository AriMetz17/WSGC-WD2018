         At this point you should just be getting a feel for what HTML looks
         like; <em>we’re going to cover everything in detail soon</em>. For now,
         just look over the HTML code and compare it to how it is represented in
         the browser. Be sure to pay careful attention to each letter annotation
         and how and where it is displayed in the browser.
      </p>
      <h2>How does the browser decide how to display the HTML?</h2>
      <p>
         HTML tells your browser about the structure of your document: where the
         headings are, where the paragraphs are, what text needs emphasis, and
         so on. Given this information, browsers have built-in default rules for
         how to display each of these elements.
      </p>
      <p>
         But you don’t have to settle for the default settings. You can add your
         own style and formatting rules with CSS that determine font, colors,
         size, and a lot of other characteristics of your page. We’ll learn more
         about CSS later.
